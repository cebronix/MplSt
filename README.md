Very buggy and extremely unfinished...
Arrow keys for nav but mouse works on most elements.
Enter = select/ok
Name create:
  Backspace = delete letters in name
  Enter = select
  No mouse support yet
Race select:
  arrow keys to select.
  Splice lets you mix-and-match.
  Buttons are toggles for each body part.
  Toggle on, select part, toggle off. If you don't toggle back off, part selected is the last button selected.
  current bug: you must select a sprite for each body part if you use splice. Can't use the defaults.
Ctrl + Enter or click green button to start "game" (just a room).
